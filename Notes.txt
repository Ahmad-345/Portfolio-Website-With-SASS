Environment Setup With Node-Sass (should be in lover case separated with _ or - )
  so, we can compile scss files and sass code into CSS.
  
  Doing everything using command line (bash terminal).

  #_1_: First we will create package.json file by using command:

  * npm init --y

  This file is kind of manifest file  which has some information about the app or the packeges we
  install such as node sass.

  #_2_: Second we install node sass,

  * npm install node-sass

  This is going to install it in folder called node_modules and will include it in
  package.json file as dependencies.

  #_3_: Now in order to use node-sass we have to create an npm script. So, we include
  the following in package.json file to script field; we also remove the default test 
  field.

  "sass": "node-sass -w scss/ -o dist/css/ --recursive"

  where: 
    node-sass is script name which we want to run,
    -w is a watch flag by which we want to constantly watch 'scss/',
    -o is the output flag and we want to output to dist/css where dist
    is the place all of our project will live html, css all what we want
    to deploy will go into dist folder,
    then we have a --recursive flag.

  #_4_: Now we run the following command..
  
  * npm run sass

  This will constantly watch our scss folder and any scass we write will be 
  compiled into Regular CSS and will be saved into dist folder with .css extention.
